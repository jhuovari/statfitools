statfitools
===========

The `statfitools` is a collection of functions to help working with a data from [Statistics Finland](http://tilastokeskus.fi). I have writen functions for my own use, but I am happy if someone else finds functions useful. Some of the functions are spesific to the data from Statistics Finland, others have more general use.

To download the data from the Statistics Finland to work with use [pxweb](https://github.com/rOpenGov/pxweb).
